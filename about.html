      <p>I practice chromatism in my work. It is a chromatic movement in music and light, a constant splitting and merging of rays, frequencies unfolding across the spectrum.</p>

      <p>I believe the world does not consist of separate particles. What appears fragmented is a manifestation of one spectrum expressed in different forms. Matter, sound, and color operate as variations of the same continuous field.</p>

      <p>Chromatic movement is adaptation. It disrupts habitual order through gradual shifts in wavelength, yet remains a natural transformation within the system. Change occurs through modulation, through transition, through controlled deviation.</p>

      <p>My works reveal this spectrum — a flow of energy embedded within the visual surface. Color carries motion. Light exposes the internal current that moves through every form.</p>
